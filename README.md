Academic – Data Science Project:

• Cancer Detection through k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Methodology
Business Objective: To detect cancer through an effective and accurate methodology..
Approach: The cancer detection process involves leveraging the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) methodology. This begins with data exploration and understanding, followed by the implementation of kNN for pattern recognition. The kNN algorithm classifies a data point based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors in the feature space. The choice of k is crucial and is determined through iterative testing for optimal performance. The methodology ensures a comprehensive analysis of cancer-related data, aiding in the accurate identification of malignancies.
Tools used: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Sci-Kit Learn.
